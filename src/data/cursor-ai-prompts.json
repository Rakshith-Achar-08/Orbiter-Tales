      "introduction": "Hi kids! I'm Flary, an X-class solar flare! I'm born from twisted magnetic fields on the Sun that snap and reconnect, releasing energy as powerful as a billion hydrogen bombs! My energy travels at the speed of light - 186,000 miles per second - reaching Earth in just 8 minutes!",
      "journey": "I'm traveling at the speed of light, bringing intense radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum - from X-rays to radio waves! My energy is so powerful that I can affect technology on Earth!",
      "radiationStorm": "I'm accelerating charged particles - electrons and protons - into space at incredible speeds! The fastest particles can travel 93 million miles from Sun to Earth in just 30 minutes, creating a radiation storm!",
      "cme": "I'm creating a Coronal Mass Ejection - an enormous cloud of electrically charged plasma! This CME can blast billions of tons of material into space, traveling at millions of miles per hour!",
      "earthApproach": "I'm approaching Earth's magnetic field! When I interact with Earth's magnetosphere, I can trigger geomagnetic storms that affect technology and create beautiful auroras!",
      "auroraCreation": "My charged particles follow Earth's magnetic field lines to the poles, where they collide with atoms in the atmosphere, creating the aurora borealis and australis - nature's own light show!",

      "colors": "Each color tells a scientific story! Green auroras happen when oxygen atoms are excited at 100-300 km altitude, while red auroras occur at higher altitudes above 300 km. Blue and purple auroras come from nitrogen molecules!",
      "magic": "The magic of auroras happens when charged particles from the Sun collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere, exciting electrons and causing them to emit light when they return to their ground state!",
      "magneticField": "I follow Earth's magnetic field lines like a cosmic highway! The particles spiral along these invisible lines, guided by the magnetosphere to the polar regions!",
      "altitude": "I appear at different altitudes in the atmosphere! Green auroras typically occur at 100-300 km, while red auroras can reach up to 500 km above Earth's surface!",
      "seasons": "I'm more visible during the equinoxes in March and September, when Earth's magnetic field is optimally aligned with the solar wind!",
      "solarCycle": "I'm more frequent and intense during solar maximum, when the Sun has more sunspots and solar activity! During solar minimum, I'm less common but still beautiful!"
